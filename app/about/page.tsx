        <h1 className="text-primary mb-6 text-base font-medium text-balance sm:text-lg">
          Hey, I&apos;m Sajad, a self-taught Frontend Engineer and Designer with
          7+ years of experience crafting intuitive, high-performing and
          user-focused web experiences.
        </h1>
        <p className="text-foreground text-base text-balance sm:text-lg">
          I discovered my love for coding at the age of 14 and have been on an
          exciting journey ever since, honing my skills and turning ideas into
          digital realities. Based in Muscat, Oman, I&apos;ve had the privilege
          of working with companies across Europe and the United States,
          building sleek websites, captivating user interfaces, and thoughtful
          designs that resonate with global audiences.
          <br />
          <br />
          As a passionate JavaScript and TypeScript enthusiast, I thrive on
          pushing boundaries in web development, not just through code, but
          through thoughtful product design. I care deeply about how things work
          and how they feel, combining frontend engineering with a strong eye
          for UX/UI to build web apps that are both beautiful and usable. My
          love for open-source fuels my drive to contribute to the global tech
          community, sharing knowledge, refining tools, and shaping experiences
          that empower developers and users alike.
          <br />
          <br />
          Driven by curiosity and an eye for detail, I continuously refine my
          craft, transforming concepts into seamless, user-friendly solutions
          that leave a lasting impression on every screen.
